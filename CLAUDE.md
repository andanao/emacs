## Architecture

This is my global emacs literate config.  The entire configuration lives in readme.org and is
tangled out to the appropriate file.


## Project Structure
- Single `.org` file containing entire emacs configuration in `readme.org` `
- Changes tangled out on save

## Style Guide
- Single `.org` file
- One heading per package for new packages ordered alphabetically
